## ðŸ§ž Getting Started

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying src/pages/Movies.jsx.
